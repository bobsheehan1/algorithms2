When the JVM is started, three class loaders are used:

    Bootstrap class loader
    Extensions class loader
    System class loader

    The bootstrap class loader loads the core Java libraries located in the <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib directory.
    This class loader, which is part of the core JVM, is written in native code.

    The extensions class loader loads the code in the extensions directories (<JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/ext, or any other directory specified by the java.ext.dirs system property).
    It is implemented by the sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader class.

    The system class loader loads code found on java.class.path, which maps to the CLASSPATH environment variable.
    This is implemented by the sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader class.

    User defined class loaders:

    So-called "servlet containers" are typically implemented in terms of multiple classloaders

    Two classes loaded by different classloaders are different.
